# BOXKit
A CSS framework for making boxes, no idea why anyone would want to use it, but many people need it, I guess?

## Description
As the first paragraph said, a CSS framework for making boxes, whether it is just a box, or some gradiented, box-shadowed, roundy boxes. It's made from 100% vanilla CSS, no preprocessors like SASS, could be included in a project or website immediately.
